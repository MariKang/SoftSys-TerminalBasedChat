# Proposal for Apellatum: Creating a Chatting Application
Jackie Zeng, Joon Kang, Mari Kang

## Goal of the Project
The goal of this project is to create a chatting application using the TCP protocol in the C language. In addition to standard chatting methods, we will implement text type emojis into the system for them to be sent to other people who are on the same system.

We are planning to base the application on a terminal, but if we have time left over we will create a GUI for better user experience of the application. As mentioned above, the chat application is going to be based on the TCP protocol, which means that it only allows local network connections.

For this problem, we will implement IP configurations for the users that would allow the connection to a host computer to chat to.

MVP: Implement a system where two users can talk to each other in an unrefined fashion. If this is successful, we will move onto more users participating in the chat and have some kind of a cleaned interface that allows the users to understand what state of the application they are in. If we are successful in implementing a full on text based chatting application, then we will move onto creating a GUI for housing the system that would allow users to interact with the software with ease.

## Learning Goals
- Learn about computer networking in general
- Learn about sockets
- Gain experience researching a field we donâ€™t know much about
- Get better at C

## Plan/ Resources
We have some initial resources that we got from softsys projects but we would love it if the teaching team can point us to relevant resources.

## First Steps

All of us will complete these tasks:

Research about networking and connections between computers that are implementable with the C language until we fully understand the concepts enough.

Come up with different connection methods - either use a p2p server or use a provided server.

Create an introduction for the program that announces the ip address of the user, name of the connected WAP, and options to join or create a hosting server on their machine.

## Process

So far, we have managed to find the necessary resources and implemented the most basic version of what our software would be based on. We have identified that there are 2 methods of achieving our goal. The first is using HTTP, and the second is using TELNET/TCP. We have come to the conclusion that the TCP/IP connection is more valid compared to the other methods of connections when we are implementing in C.

## Future Steps

The three main tasks that we are working on currently is the basic implementation of a TCP/IP connection module, the creation of the emoji switch library and the login/introduction page of the program when it boots up. These are the three main components of our program - it does need to be further implemented by adding in the chatting feature, but that should not be too difficult. We will consider these steps to be "done" when we build a fully functional connection module with error catches, have a complete library with emojis, and have a fully functioning introduction page that lets the user figure out what the connection IP and port is for the host server.

A step that we are currently thinking about implementing after going through the MVP is to combine the client and host modules together so that we can have a server/client node in the same program. If we manage to make the program selectable in terms of whether the user wants to connect to a server or open up one, then this will be a further step from the MVP.
